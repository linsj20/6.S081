# 61C Spring 2022 Project 1: Snake

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/)

TODO: describe what you did

At Task 2,stuck for a while for when:
    A allocated char* is assigned to "some string" it cannot be freed.
    Forget to leave a space for '\0' when allocating space for char*.   
At Task 5,spend too much time distinguishing fscanf and getline(retain the \n).
At Task 6 in find-head,took a while to find the ignored case.
